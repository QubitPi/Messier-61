 * A knowledge graph is a directed labeled graph in which the labels have well-defined meanings. A directed labeled
 * graph consists of nodes, edges, and labels. Anything can act as a node, for example, people, company, computer, etc.
 * An edge connects a pair of nodes and captures the relationship of interest between them, for example, friendship
 * relationship between two people, customer relationship between a company and person, or a network connection between
 * two computers. The labels capture the meaning of the relationship, for example, the friendship relationship between
 * two people.
