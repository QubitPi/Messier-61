Messier-61 Landing Page
=======================

This is a the product landing page of Paion's External Brain with a one page view. The design is inspired by a template
from [Free-CSS.com](https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/). All 'visual'
data can be easily modified by changing the [data.json](./src/data/data.json) file.

To run the landing page locally:

```bash
cd Messier-61/packages/messier-61-app
yarn
yarn start
```

Change the data in the ```data.json``` file as well as add any images to ```public/img/```. Styles can also be modified
in the ```public/css``` files.
