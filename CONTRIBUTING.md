Contributing to Messier-61
==========================

Raise an Issue
--------------

If you think you might have hit a bug (it happens occasionally!) or you have specific feature request then use
[Github Issues][issue link]. Check whether someone else may have already raised something similar, as it is incredibly
helpful to have related information all together.

How to contribute
-----------------

We're grateful for any thoughts you share, including in code form. To contribute a fix or a new feature we have a little
bit of process you'll need to follow:

- Do all your work in a personal fork of the original repository
- [Rebase](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request), don't merge (we prefer to keep our
  history clean)
- Create a branch (with a useful name) for your contribution
- Include unit tests if appropriate (obviously not necessary for documentation changes)

We can't guarantee that we'll accept pull requests and may ask you to make some changes before they go in.
Occasionally, we might also have logistical, commercial, or legal reasons why we can't accept your work but we'll try to
find an alternative way for you to contribute in that case.
