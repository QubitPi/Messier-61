Messier-61 Documentation
========================

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Installation
------------

```bash
yarn
```

Local Development
-----------------

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

Build
-----

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.

A [TypeDoc](https://qubitpi.github.io/typedoc-site/)-autogenerated directory, called `api`, will also be generated under
the `build` directory as part of the build. When Messier-61 documentation is deployed onto GitHub Pages, the API will
[also be served](https://paion-data.github.io/Messier-61/api)

Deployment
----------

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the
`gh-pages` branch.
