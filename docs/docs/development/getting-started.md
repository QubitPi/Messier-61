Before committing your code, please run the following checks locally in order to give ourselves better confidence that
the code will pass the automated checks online:

1. Prettier our code:

   ```bash
   npx prettier --write .
   ```

2. Check code style using ESLint:

   ```bash
   npx eslint .
   ```

   :::caution

   ESLint currently does not run on documentation source codes, i.e. `/docs`

   :::

3. Run all tests

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Available Scripts

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build Production Bundle

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the
build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### Writing TypeDoc

The [Messier-61 API][API] page was automatically generated by
[TypeDoc](https://qubitpi.github.io/typedoc-site/guides/overview/), which parses the inline documentation of
Messier-61 source code. To generated them locally

```bash
cd docs
yarn typedoc
```

:::info

TypeDoc processes all source files under `Messier-61/packages/` except for the following

- Test files (`*.test.*`)
- `Messier-61/packages/messier-61-app/messier-61-env.d.ts`
- `Messier-61/packages/messier-61-app/setupTests.ts`

:::

We can have TypeDoc watch for changes from the command line by using

```bash
yarn typedoc-watch
```

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Docusaurus Relative Linking is Treated False-Negative by CI Markdown Link check

CI check for Markdown link (`markdown-link-check`) is turned on and it's not smart enough to detect relative linking by
Docusaurus. The workaround is to disable the link check at the relevant line. For example:

```markdown
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
known. Additionally, this process makes it easy to implement a [blue-green deployment](continuous-delivery) or
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
```
